1. Execute command - chmod 755 execute.sh to give read, write and execute permission to the shell script

2. Execute command - ./execute.sh

3. Give appropiate input values

4. The program might take multiple hours to execute

5. The Algorithm checks the Satisfiablity of randomly generated Propositional statements and plots 2 graphs described in (6)

6. 20 Testcase files have been generated for every value of (number of clauses)/(number of variable)  (m/n) in the range [0, 8] (with granularity 0.1). The program for generating Testcase files
   is in file - "test_cases_walksat.py"

7. The Graphs plotted are: 
	"Graph1.png" (m/n ratio Vs Probability of Satisfiablility)
	"Graph2.png" (m/n ratio Vs Total iterations in the modified Algorithm)
